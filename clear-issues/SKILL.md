# Clear Issues

## Overview

Main agent orchestrates the full lifecycle of resolving GitHub issues. Each phase has explicit owners. User can override any decision with explicit instruction at any time.

**Core principle:** Issues are investigated before dispatched, implemented in isolated worktrees, reviewed by a separate agent, and only merged after CI passes. No shortcuts.

## When to Use

Explicitly invoke this skill when the user says:
- `/clear-issues`
- "clear the backlog"

Do NOT trigger on casual discussion about issues or questions about issue status.

---

## Phase 1: Grill

**Owner:** Main agent

1. Pull open issues. Pick up to **3** most clearly scoped issues to grill in parallel.
2. Run `/grill-me` on each issue. `/grill-me` declares when ready — it is the primary signal.
3. Main agent applies checklist **after** grill-me signals ready, before dispatching:
   - [ ] Root cause identified
   - [ ] Files/modules touched known
   - [ ] Test strategy defined
   - [ ] No open dependencies
   - [ ] Dependency signals checked in issue comments first
4. Check issue comments for dependency signals before grilling.
5. Build file-scope map across grilled issues to flag module overlap before dispatching.
6. If issue depends on a dispatched issue → comment dependency on issue, skip dispatch, grill next.

**Implementer questions queue:** While main agent is mid-grill, implementer questions (from previously dispatched issues) queue up. Answer them after the current grill batch completes — unless a question reveals a dependency that would change which issues to grill. In that case, resolve the dependency signal immediately.

**Scope discovery:** If implementer discovers issue has multiple concerns → it stops, comments on issue, asks main agent. Do NOT broaden scope unilaterally.

**Implementer idle time:** Implementers are created in Phase 2, after grill clears for their issue. While waiting for their issue to be grilled, the implementer is not created yet — there is no idle time to waste. Questions from newly dispatched implementers are answered normally during subsequent grill cycles.

---

## Phase 2: Dispatch

**Owner:** Main agent

1. Create git worktree for each implementer (branch from current master). Use `superpowers:using-git-worktrees` skill.
2. Read `dispatch-template.md` and dispatch implementer using the **Implementer Dispatch Template**.
3. Track issue state in task list:
   - `pending` → `grilling` → `dispatched` → `implement` → `review` → `CI` → `merged` → `closed`
4. Dispatch as issues clear `/grill-me` — don't wait for all in-flight issues to clear.

**Rule:** Parallel dispatch for independent issues. Each PR merges when its own CI is green and review is approved.

---

## Phase 3: Implement

**Owner:** Implementer subagent (runs in worktree)

Follow the dispatch template exactly. Key rules:

1. **Write failing test first** — `/test-driven-development` skill mandates this. Test must fail before fix.
2. **Simplify synchronously** — wait for `/simplify` results, apply all findings, commit before PR.
3. **Scope discipline** — if scope discovery occurs, stop and ask. Do not broaden unilaterally.
4. **Notify** — after PR is up, notify main agent with PR URL.

---

## Phase 4: Review

**Owner:** Reviewer subagent

Read `dispatch-template.md`. When dispatched to review, use the **Reviewer Dispatch Template**.

**Scope adherence check:** The reviewer MUST verify the PR actually and only does what the issue scoped. If the implementer reverted the change just to pass review — the PR is obviously not ready. The fix must address the root cause, not merely make tests pass by removing the broken behavior.

---

## Phase 5: CI & Merge

**Owner:** Main agent

1. **Wait for CI before merge** — "PR ready" means reviewed, not mergeable
2. Squash merge to master
3. Delete branch immediately after merge
4. Delete worktree after merge
5. Monitor CI post-merge:
   - If CI fails → dispatch implementer for fix, same workflow
   - Do not close issue until CI is green on master

**Conflict handling:** If master moves while PR is open → main agent detects conflict, dispatches implementer to rebase. Clean rebase → merge. Conflict-resolved changes → reviewer sanity pass before merge. After any rebase, immediately run `git diff` against the expected state to verify all intended changes survived — do not assume the merge or rebase was correct.

---

## Phase 6: Close

**Owner:** Main agent

1. After PR merged and CI green on master:
   - **Verify the fix exists in master code before closing** — run verification commands to confirm the code state matches what the issue asked for (e.g., if issue says "remove package X", verify `grep package.json` shows it's gone; if issue says "replace lib A with lib B", verify no imports of A remain). CI passing proves tests run. Code inspection proves the fix exists.
   - Comment on issue with summary of changes and CI status
   - Close issue
2. If regression surfaces later:
   - File new issue, run full workflow from scratch
   - Post-mortem goes to MEMORY.md (not the closed issue)

## State Machine

```
IDLE ──► GRILLING (1-3 in parallel)
              │
              ├──► DISPATCHED ──► IMPLEMENT ──► REVIEW ──► CI ──► MERGED ──► CLOSED
              │         (worktree+implementer)    (fresh impl on fix rounds)
              │
              └──► SKIPPED (dependency on in-flight issue)
                       (no worktree, comment added, issue waits for dependency)
```

---

## User Interrupt Handling

- **Explicit instruction always wins** — "handle issue #X" overrides any queue
- **"Drop everything"** — main agent pauses current grill cycle, handles new issue immediately
- **Normal new request** — queued, answered after current phase completes

---

## Key Decisions (always apply)

1. Wait for CI before merge — never merge on "PR ready" alone
2. Fresh implementer on fix rounds — no path dependency contamination
3. Scope adherence — see Phase 4. Reviewer verifies PR only does what the issue scoped; root cause must be fixed, not symptoms gamed to pass tests.
4. `git rebase --skip` is a red-line — never skip commits during rebase without first verifying what the skipped commit contains and getting explicit confirmation that skipping is safe. Skipping drops commits permanently.
5. Never close an issue based on CI passing or PR merge alone — always verify the actual code state in master matches the fix the issue requested. If CI is green but the code doesn't match, the fix was lost (e.g., during a rebase) and must be re-applied.
6. `/grill-me` is primary signal; main agent checklist is the gate — grill-me declares first, checklist applied after before dispatching.
